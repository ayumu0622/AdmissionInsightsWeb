# ucschools_datavisualize_webapp
## In this repository, there are codes composing this web app https://ayumu0622-tbm-app-vptakp.streamlit.app/ 
## the csv data used to visualize was retrieved from https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/about-us/information-center/transfers-major
I built this webapp to make it easier for community college students to figure out which major 
they want to apply for University of California schools as a tranfer student since I also 
experienced to spend lots of time to see college admission stats on the above website and had thought how nice if we were able to see this data with graphs.
